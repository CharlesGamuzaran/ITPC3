                <p>No matter if you're an automotive guru or a novice enthusiast, you've definitely heard the term "JDM" at least once before. It stands for "Japanese Domestic Market" and refers to cars that were made by Japanese companies, obeying the country's regulations. Simple enough. But Japan is a country like any other, so what then makes these JDM cars so special and sought-after that a whole automotive subculture has arisen around them?</p>
                <p>JDM cars remain extremely popular today, yet there are still some out there who aren't sure exactly what qualifies as a JDM. Even more, there are hardcore gearheads who don't realize what is and isn't a true JDM. We've updated this post with info regarding this important and burgeoning auto subculture to set the record straight.</p>

            <h4>About Us</h4>
            <p>At JDM Collection we are passionate about cars and are on a mission. We want to develop a resource that provides visitors with the best of information and advice for ‘all things automotive’. Cars today are so much more than mere conveyances that take people from A to B. They represent the cumulative experience and emotion of over a century of discovery, aesthetic design, and engineering. From the earliest steam-powered vehicles, to the emergence of electric propulsion, the motor car moves us not just physically but in <br>our thoughts and our dreams.</p>
